# Customer Segmentation Analysis
## Project Overview
This project aims to perform customer segmentation analysis for an e-commerce company. By analyzing customer behavior and purchase patterns, the goal is to group customers into distinct segments. This segmentation can inform targeted marketing plans, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall business plans.

## Key Concepts and Features
Data Collection: Obtains a dataset containing customer information, purchase history, and relevant data.

Data Exploration and Cleaning: Explores the dataset's structure, identifies missing or inconsistent data, and prepares it for analysis.

Descriptive Statistics: Calculates key metrics such as average purchase value, frequency of purchases, and spending scores.

Customer Segmentation: Utilizes clustering algorithms (specifically K-Means) to segment customers based on their behavior and purchase patterns.

Visualization: Creates various visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, bar charts) to illustrate customer segments and their characteristics.

Insights and Recommendations: Analyzes the characteristics of each segment and provides actionable recommendations for business plans.

# Dataset
The project uses a dataset named customer_segmentation_data.csv.

## Expected Output

1 Elbow Method Plot: To help determine the optimal number of clusters.

2 Silhouette Scores Plot: To further evaluate the quality of clustering for different K values.

3 Customer Segments: Income vs. Spending Score: A scatter plot showing customer distribution across segments based on income and spending.

4 Gender Distribution per Cluster & Preferred Category Distribution per Cluster: Two bar plots in one figure illustrating demographic and preference breakdowns within each segment.

5  Average Feature Values per Cluster: A bar plot summarizing the average values of numerical features for each cluster, providing a clear profile of each segment.
